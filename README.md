# Acebook-Blunicorn

This Java/ Spring application was built during the group engineering project week at Makers. The goal was to build a web app that has some of the features and functionality of Facebook. We decided to build this in a stack that was brand new to all of us because we wanted a challenge and we wanted to showcase our ability to learn quickly. 

## The stack:
* Maven to build the project
* Webpack to bundle the javacript
* Thymeleaf to serve index.html
* React to make requests to the api and render the component views

## Set Up Instructions
* Fork and clone this repository to your machine
* Use an IDE, like intellij, and select the project directory to load into the editor
* Run the main application
* Visit localhost:8080
